# App configuration
#
# The ahps_web.conf file holds the configuration data in JSON format.
# Currently, it looks like this:
#
#   {
#     "DatabasePath": "/path/to/database/file",
#     "Server": "hostname",
#     "Port": "9999"
#   }
#
# The JSON parser is quite finicky about strings being quoted as shown above.
#
# This class behaves like a singleton class. There is only one instance of the configuration.
# There is no need to create an instance of this class, as everything about it is static.
