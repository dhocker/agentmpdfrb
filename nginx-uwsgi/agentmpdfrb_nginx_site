    # BUG: This does not work because url redirections by the app do
    # not have the proper app prefix. Hence, they do not route correctly.
    # The "location /" line below is a temporary work-around for the
    # single app case. It will not work with multiple apps.
    # Unfortunately, the app needs to properly prefix any url it
    # redirects. Also, any AJAX calls from the client must be properly
    # prefixed with the app name.
